				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The current economic scenario shows a boom in the eCommerce sector especially for Russia, India and other developing countries. With more people opting to purchase off the internet, the e-shopping site seems to be catching on here.</p>
<p>The internet is already flooded with a multitude of eCommerce websites, so how can you do better than them?If you are planning on setting up a shopping site, you need to find a platform, choose your host and a template or customize it to develop a website to suit your requirements.</p>
<p>There are plenty of eCommerce platforms on the net and it could be quite confusing to zero in on one. This article is an attempt at making it easier for you to choose one.</p>
<p>We can broadly classify eCommerce platforms into three, namely Hosted,Open Source and Hosted Shopping Cart.</p>
<p><strong>Hosted platforms:</strong></p>
<p>They require a monthly or yearly fee for their services and it generally includes web hosting along with an e-commerce system and support. In this case you cant choose a different host but, you don’t have to worry over security or support issues as the platform would solve all these issues efficiently since, its their system and they know how to run it!</p>
<p><strong>Open source:</strong></p>
<p>these platforms enable you to download and host your website from anywhere. This gives designers and developers the freedom to design and develop.</p>
<p><strong>Hosted shopping cart:</strong></p>
<p>Gives you the freedom to choose the CMS and host of your choice, they provide only the shopping cart and handle the checkout process.</p>
<p>Today we will check out the best choices for Hosted Platforms and in the next two articles I will be following up on open source and hosted shopping cart platforms. These are just a few of the popular ones, do feel free to give your comments and ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Hosted Platforms: Looking at the prominent features.</strong></p>

<p>What makes High wire different from other platforms is its Multiple channel approach, besides selling on your own site you can also sell on Face book,Bonanza and ebay. It gives you an integrated inventory so that a purchase made anywhere is reflected throughout the system.</p>
<p>Besides these goodies High wire is stuffed with plenty of useful marketing features like discount codes, offer certificates, allows customers to post reviews and integrate with mailing lists.</p>

Its easy to integrate templates, intuitive user interface and tons of features make it a good choice for a hosted platform. Shopify hosts websites on its own servers so there would be no security issues, besides it also has no bandwidth limits and has a Content Delivery network to ensure a speedy load. Like highwire, this platform also offers a ton of free templates to choose from. They also have a theme shop for premium templates at around $100 -$200 dollars. Another feature that they offer is custom designing, you can custom design templates for your site and Shopify would even recommend designers for you.</p>
<p>This platform too is mobile ready and provides responsive templates and shopping cart features as well. The back end setup enables you to store order &amp; customer data and even create customer groups. The CMS enables easy updates and powers a blogging engine too. The shopping cart integrates with over 70 payment gateways so its a good option if you want to switch your current platform.</p>
<p>You can also integrate with search engines as you allowed to control Page titles, URL, alt tags and much more.</p>
<p><strong>Shopify offers a flexible payment plan:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>a 14 day trial pack on all of its plans.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A web design project can be pretty vast, even the simplest of designs would require extensive planning and implementation and would have to follow an entire process to successfully complete it. It&#8217;s quite possible to miss out certain things amidst all that madness. Once you have a checklist in place its easy to do a follow up and strike off tasks as you proceed towards the completion of the project.<br />
A perfect checklist would obviously come with experience, so here&#8217;s what I thought should be included in a designer&#8217;s checklist. While drafting a checklist, how deep you want to delve into a subject is a personal view.  So, this is entirely my take on the subject, feel free to add to it.</p>
<p><strong> Accessibility &amp; Usability</strong><br />
In this section i will be broadly covering the most common issues with respect o the accessibility and usability of your website. By accessibility I mean the ease with which a user can get to the content on your website and the usability/ user -experience that your site gives its visitors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1. Site Load-time</strong><br />
A good site load time would be somewhere between 5seconds to 9 seconds. Again personally i feel that 9 seconds could on the higher end. A very lean page with all the CSS moved to an external CSS file and all the images(use as little as possible) optimized to perfection will help reduce page loading time. Another option to consider is caching the site on a server or a CDN.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. Text-to-Background Contrast</strong><br />
While considering backgrounds remember to implement the right contrast, though certain combinations may look nice it&#8217;s not always the best choice. Choose contrasts that are not difficult to stare at for long periods of time. Typically the conventional black text on a white background works the best.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. Font Size/Spacing</strong><br />
The ideal size for text is still difficult to fix, it has a lot to do with the type, theme and aesthetics of the website. But what you can do in this segment is to ensure that readability is maintained. Use spacing to aid the legibility of your site. White spaces will help you organize the content and de-clutter  your site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4. Flash &amp; Add-ons</strong><br />
Stick to the regular HTML/CSS as nothing can beat them. The drawback with flash is that it requires plug-ins and time to download. The user would definitely not have the patience to go through a Flash experience, so don&#8217;t subject them to it unless it is absolutely necessary or contributes to the goal of your website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5. ALT Tags for Images</strong><br />
Alt tag descriptions for your images would make them search-engine friendly and also cater to visually impaired users on your website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6. Work on the 404 Page</strong><br />
Make sure that your website has a custom 404 page which guides the user to the home page or has a site-map on it, letting the user decide where he/she wants to go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Identity</strong><br />
Your website is your identity and should  portray everything about you. It should answer the most obvious questions like &#8211; “Who you are and what you do?” and even better if gets its visitors to understand “Why trust you.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7. Company Logo</strong><br />
The logo is what people would instantly relate to your brand, so place the logo where it is easily visible. The best place would be on the top left hand corner of the page and this is exactly where people expect the logo to be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>8. Tagline explaining the Purpose of your Company</strong><br />
Frame a catchy and meaningful tagline to accompany your logo explaining &#8216;What you do.&#8217; A good practice is to avoid jargon and keep it simple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>9. Home-page – easy to skim</strong><br />
Whoever visits your website would not spend more than 5 seconds to scan through the page and decide whether they want to stay on the page or not. The page should be able to communicate the gist of the entire website in a short glance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>10. Company Information</strong><br />
Though the “About us ” section is pretty stereotypical, it has all the information that a visitor would want to know about you and your company. So keep these pages easy to comprehend, clear and as  interesting as possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>11.  Contact Information</strong><br />
The &#8216;contact us&#8217; is the most important Part of any website, it explains how your potential client can get to you. So, as I rule I suggest putting up multiple options for communication like an email address, contact number, a Response form which the client can fill out and in some cases the physical address so that if the need be they can visit you directly. Also make sure that you leave this information as a text instead of an image so that search engines can pick it up.</p>
<p><strong>Navigation</strong><br />
A major contributor to the usability of your website and the accessibility of the contents on your website. How you arrange your content is also crucial; the entire subject of information architecture is quite vast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>12. Main Navigation</strong><br />
The main  menu gives the user instant access to the main parts of the website, so they should be easy to find and use. If you have more than one navigation on your website, demarcate them clearly and ensure that their difference is evident.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>13. Navigation Labels</strong><br />
Menus and navigations are supposed to be self explanatory, so ensure that the labels are concise, clear and obvious. Make things easy to understand and grasp.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>14. Number of Buttons/Links</strong><br />
Stick to a limited number of menu items , I guess 6-7 would be alright. Visitors would not appreciate anything more than 7 menu items.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>15. Company Logo – a direct link to the Home-page</strong><br />
The general tendency for visitors is to expect the logo of a website to lead them to the homepage. So, its best to link the same to avoid the confusion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>16.  Consistent &amp; Easy to Identify Links</strong><br />
Links on your site should be conspicuous and the standard protocol is to make them blue and underline them. Stick to the same as visitors expect them and are familiar with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>17. Site Search box</strong><br />
The Search box is a very useful tool and again as per standard guidelines users expect to find them at the top right corner of the page. So, its best to keep them exactly where they are expected to be.</p>
<p><strong>Content</strong><br />
Content is everything, after you have managed to woo the visitors to stay on you site with an impressive design and all the visual features, the next thing that draws the visitors attention is the content. Basically content is what really matters the success of your site largely depends on its content.<br />
<strong>18. Major Headings</strong><br />
Visitors always skim through a website before they actually get down to reading the entire contents. So one way to keep them on your site is to use headings and subheadings. As headings are conspicuous and come to the notice of the beholder, another option is to use meaningful visuals so that the gist of the content is understood. From an SEO perspective use Relevant headings and heading tags.<br />
<strong>19. Critical Content Is Above The Fold</strong><br />
Place your content such that the important parts stay above the fold. The fold is an imaginary line, it denotes where the screen cuts off a page. The trick is to fit all the crucial contents in the first frame of the website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>20. Consistent Styles &amp; Colors</strong><br />
Consistency is another feature that puts users at ease, that way they wont have to go through the entire learning curve again and again on each page. So try and maintain a consistency especially in the style, color ,layout headings and navigation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>21. Emphasis (bold, etc.) Is Used Sparingly</strong><br />
When I spoke about highlighting and making content easier to read, I meant it has to be used sparingly, there should be substantial contrast between the highlighted content and the rest. If you end up making everything bold, you would not create sufficient contrast which differentiates  one thing from the other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>22. Ads &amp; Pop-ups</strong><br />
Ads have to be incorporated in your site in a very subtle manner. It should not be a hassle for your visitors or be a reason for them to flee from your site. Remember not to clutter your pages with adds and when you do put up ads be selective and make them clear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>23. Concise &amp; Explanatory content</strong><br />
About the copy writing – say whatever you have to say in a precise and concise manner. Use as little words as possible to clearly explain what you want to. This works better than layers and layers of wishful writing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>24.  Meaningful &amp; User-friendly URL</strong><br />
While finalizing the URL it&#8217;s better if you frame the same using useful keywords that are meaningful as it would be easy to remember as well as SEO friendly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>25. Explanatory HTML Page Titles</strong><br />
HTML page titles should be unique meaningful and must not be an overload of key words. This is where the search engine crawls first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This article is a collection of features or trends that we can expect to see in the coming year. The year 2012 was a very creative one indeed and it has passed on several features that have to be played around with and refined to give amazing results. So this year I expect to see great creativity and a lot of new features to pop-up</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Home page Tours and sliding images</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Websites are constantly trying to keep their users positively engaged and engrossed. Sliding images and demo videos are an interesting way of going about the same. They have to be carefully and craftily constructed and integrated to keep the user engrossed and not annoyed. If properly used this works well on Landing pages and can even look very good on a web page. These little tours give valuable info to the user and in a way can improve the learning curve of your website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong> Sliding Webpage Panels using CSS</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>There was a time when dynamic websites with their fancy flash and ActionScript were a rave. But the flaws soon began to show and so these effects sort of died down. However, nowadays JavaScript /JQuery influence the way in which websites are designed. One such technique which is soon gaining popularity is the sliding panel.</p>
<p>Some websites ingeniously use this in their navigation. <a href="http://captaindash.com/">CaptainDash</a> implements navigation such that the page is loaded like a sliding panel from right to left. If it can be integrated with responsive techniques it could be a really cool effect to put on your website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong> Mobile Navigation and Toggle</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This is an excellent feature especially for responsive designs where space is a limiting factor. You would be able to build a solid navigation, give direct access to the important links on your site even if there are a space constrains. You can use a toggle that temporarily; hides the navigation until it is needed.</p>
<p>This feature is very important for mobile phones. This year I expect to see a lot of mobile toggle menus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong> Fullscreen Typography – pretty effective!</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Another trend that seems to be catching on is the use of big oversized typography that spans the entire screen of the browser. But this feature needs to be implemented carefully. You have to use the right layout and have the text perfectly fitted using rich text effects from CSS3. Make the website easy to navigate and balance the other elements on the page proportionately</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong> APIs &amp; Open Source</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Open source software has revolutionized the web and continues to do so. These Application Program Interfaces allow designers to prototype layouts, animations and other page effects. JQuery itself has numerous number of plugins for free downloads on the internet. It’s now possible to get access to a variety of open source software like web page widgets, layouts and several other dynamic effects.</p>
<p>So we could watch out for free templates, layouts or CMS software like WordPress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong> Deep Box Shadows using CSS3</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>CSS3 box shadows I presume will continue to present itself in various forms, integrated with a number of design elements. They give some amazing effects and go well with the general aesthetics of the website.</p>
<p>Previously, it was difficult to implement box shadows using JavaScript, but ever since the CSS3 it’s ‘been a piece o cake!’ so, this year round I expect to see some creative use of the shadow box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong> CSS3 Animations</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The CSS3 has some very useful properties like the transition which enable dynamic effects similar to JavaScript. Animation is now possible using CSS properties. Similar to the hover effects and form input fields , this time I hope to see a lot more happening.</p>
<p>There is plenty of potential here and I hope to see the results soon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="8">
<li><strong> Vertical Navigations</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This is a relatively new trend, arranging all the navigation on a vertical axis was not done before and could look quite different . But, if implemented craftily it could really make your website look great. Sort and arrange your design layout accordingly and use the right colors and graphics and you could pull of an excellent design.</p>
<p>My personal favorite is the <a href="http://riotindustries.com/">Riot Industries</a>. They have categorized and neatly and distinctly made proper borders to understand what they are conveying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="9">
<li><strong> Circular Design Elements</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Circles have appeared throughout 2012, but this year I’m expecting to see more of it and more creative uses for the circle. Circles are neat and fit into any layout block, so basically circles could be used for a variety of purposes. It can be used to build patterns and then fix the other page elements into circular designs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>
<p>The user interface of a website is one of the major parameters on which the design is made. The layouts, navigations, images, content and its presentation are all made with the user and the functionality in mind. These are the design trends I hope would be seen through a majority of websites this year.</p>
